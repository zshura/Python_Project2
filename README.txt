Project 1 by Zofia Shura

To play the Hampshire College Trivia Game, launch with Idle and play through the Shell.
The Hampshire College Trivia Game asks questions about the college and returns your final score upon completion.


The Hampshire College Trivia Game code starts by asking the player to choose a difficulty level.
Once the player chooses, it assigns a different score_modifier for the different levels.
The player will then be prompted with five questions.
At the completion of all of the five questions, the player will receive their score and be asked if they would like to play again.
